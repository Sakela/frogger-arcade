The goal of the game is to reach the top of the game screen (*water blocks*) and avoid collision with bugs. From time to time you will see loot drop on the game screen. To collect the loot you need to get the player on the same block. Loot give you **3 additional points** while reaching the water line gives you **1 point each time**. To reset the game and choose another character or start over, hit refresh button in your browser window.
